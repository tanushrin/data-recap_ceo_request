🏋️‍♀️ This is the final challenge of the week (you have until the end of the Communicate topic to complete it).

**Before diving into it, take time to finish the challenge 02 on sellers analysis (Liner Regression topic)**.

## Problem

>❓ How many underperforming sellers should Olist remove to improve its profit, given that it has:
> - some revenues per sellers per months
> - some revenues per orders
> - some reputation costs (estimated) per bad reviews
> - some operational costs of IT system that grows with number of orders, but not linearly (scale effects)

  <summary markdown='span'>💡 Hints</summary>
- You may want to compute the review cost of each order first, then sum these costs by seller.
</details>

## ✏️ Your turn!

👉 **Open the `ceo_request.ipynb` notebook and start from there.**

- We'll start from a blank Notebook
- Refrain from re-using from previous notebooks - they were made for investigation only
- All your re-usable logic is coded in `olist/*.py` scripts
